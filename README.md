# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 18 - Study of the optimization of Squalene production in Synechocystis  sp. PCC 6803

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

The project aims to study the optimisation of the genome-scale model (GSM) IJN678 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the production of Squalene (C30H50), a triterpene, which has applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic industry and could also be used as biofuel. The model was chosen not only based on its adequacy but also its fidelity.

Firstly, the maximum growth and yields under three different conditions, autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic were analysed. Even though, autotrophic condition did not give the highest growth rate, the observed productivity was substantially higher. Moreover, from a sustainable point of view, autotrophy is considered the best mode of operation for squalene production. After determining the optimal phenotypical characteristics for squalene production, the rate of squalene synthesis was analyzed through different gene regulation and overexpression strategies including heterologous expression, gene and cofactor optimization through OptGene and OptSwap algorithms, and flux scanning analysis. In the next and final step, the simulation of batch cultivation was conducted. The performance of the predicted models was assessed and the final remarks of the project were stated through discussion and conclusion. 

## Project overview
This repository consists of 3 folders which are used to store project figures (Figures), inspirational GitHub respositories (Inspiration), and supplementary notebooks (Supplementary Notebooks). Beside folders, the repository includes the main project report called "Report.ipynb", additional notebooks and models that were used to performed GSM optimisations. The list of packages required for the project are summarized inside the file called "requirements.txt". Finally, the repository contains two important python files ("delete.py" and "gcOpt_coding_file.py") which needs to be kept in the repository as they are vital to keep "OptGene" package functioning in the report.
