# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 18 - Optimization of squalene production in Synechocystis PCC 6803

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

The project aims to optimise the genome-scale model (GSM) IJN678 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the production of Squalene (C30H50), a triterpene, which has applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic industry and could also be used as biofuel. The model was chosen not only based on its adequacy but also its fidelity.

Firstly, the maximum growth and yields under three different conditions, autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic were analysed. Even though, autotrophic condition did not give the highest growth rate, but the productivity is substantially higher. Moreover, from a sustainable point of view, autotrophy is considered the best mode of operation for squalene production.
