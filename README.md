> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

The project aims to study the optimisation of the genome-scale model (GSM) IJN678 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the production of Squalene (C30H50), a triterpene, which has applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic industry and could also be used as biofuel. The model was chosen not only based on its adequacy but also its fidelity.

Firstly, the maximum growth and yields under three different conditions, autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic were analysed. Even though, autotrophic condition did not give the highest growth rate, the observed productivity was substantially higher. Moreover, from a sustainable point of view, autotrophy is considered the best mode of operation for squalene production. After determining the optimal phenotypic characteristics for squalene production, the rate of squalene synthesis through different gene regulation strategies including heterologous expression of alternative pathways suchs as mevalonate pathway, as well as, implementation of gene and cofactor optimization through OptGene and OptSwap algorithms.... 



## Project overview
This repository consist of 3 folders which are used to store project figures (Figures), inspirational GitHub respositories (Inspiration), and supplementary notebooks (Supplementary Notebooks). Beside folders, the repository includes the main project report called "Report.ipynb", additional notebooks and models that were used to performed GSM optimisations. The list of packages required for the project are summarized inside the file called "requirements.txt". Finally, the repository contains two important python files ("delete.py" and "gcOpt_coding_file.py") which needs to be kept in the repository as they are vital to keep "OptGene" package functioning in the report.
